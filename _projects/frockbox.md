# Content
intro_title: What's in the box?
intro_content: Jenna's subscription service was growing fast. More users were subscribing everyday, but her current third-party solution couldn't keep up with the increased demand. That's when she knew she needed something custom.

content_1_title: This time it's personal
content_1: "There were two main objectives with the upgrade: streamline the current business processes to reduce workload and overhead, and refresh the user experience for subscribers that emphasized their unique feature of providing the user with a personal stylist."

content_2_title: An endless wardrobe
content_2: A big bottleneck with processing orders was choosing pieces for each user. The stylist would have to go through each rack of clothes and pick out which pieces to include for each order. We removed the need for stylists to physically look at each piece by bringin the entire catalogue online, allowing the stylist to view, filter, and add a piece to a subscribers order.

features:
    - A flexible subscription system that simplifies the  entire user experience from sign-up to returns.
    - Online catalogue and stylist dashboard allowing for stylists to browse clothes and pack orders wihtout ever having to leave their computer.
    - Payment and shipping integration with Stripe and Shipstation to automate subscription charges and mail order generation.
    - Refreshed marketing site with dynamic content and a new responsive design.

content_3_title: The empress' new clothes
content_3: The new and improved system was praised not only by Jenna, but by her staff and subscribers alike. With a new streamlined workflow and improved user experience, Frockbox is all set to improve people's style for years to come.
