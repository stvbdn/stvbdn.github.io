# Content
intro_title: Crawl before you walk
intro_content: UWalk had the goal of incorporating fitness more holistically into people's lives. At home, at work, or wherever life takes you - fitness should be easy and fun to track. We helped them achieve this goal by building out their online platform.

content_1_title: It all begins with a single step
content_1: Allowing users to sync their steps with a Fitbit or Garmin device, and also letting users manually enter their steps, the application lets users track their activity however they see fit.

content_2_title: If you want to go far, go together
content_2: Community engagment was a big part of the UWalk's goal. We build out community challenges that would allow users to compete cooperatively and competively against each other to reach their goal.

features:
    - Activity tracking of both steps and stairs by connecting a fitness tracking device or by manually entering activiy.
    - Achievement system that lets users earn badges by accomplishing daily challenges or by hitting milestones.
    - A feature-rich community section that lets user's create and join communities with their fellow walkers to compete cooperatively and competively in challenges.
    - Beautiful dashboard for users to view current and historical step data, along with friends activity and challenge progress.

content_3_title: Stepping their game up
content_3: The launch of UWalk received much buzz and was embraced immediately by businesses looking to engage their employees with a fun and engaging way of incorporating fitness into their worklife.
