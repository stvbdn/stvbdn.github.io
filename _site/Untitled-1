This is the phase where we acutally build the website/application. Depending on the size of the website/application.

Production:
This is the phase where the website/application gets built. Depending on the scope and size of the project, this phase may be broken up into smallers phases to provide deliverables at important feature milestones that the client can test.

Launch:
When the client is ready for their project to go live, we make the appropriate DNS and server changes to launch their site along with any redirects they may need. For applications we ensure that everything has been set to production mode, and that the app is available for purchase/download.

Post Launch:
We offer a 30 day warantee with our projects. If there are any bugs or QA that arise during that period, we will take care of them at no additional charge. For any bugs beyond the 30 day warantee or for additional features, we will provide an estimate for cost.



During this phase, we also provide instructions for the client on the new content entry they will need to provide.
